    About: 
        Travel Game will be similar to Oregon Trail but differs as it takes 
        mechanics from Fallout and DnD.A skill based system will determines 
        in-game actions and decisions that will impact the ending the player 
        will get. Random chance events can occur during the story as well and 
        can impact endings if correct or incorrect choices are made. Like DnD, 
        die roll chances are affected by player stats.

    Setting:
        Post-apocalyptic United states.

    Program Details:
        This game will be written in C++ and should be able to run on multiple 
        platforms
