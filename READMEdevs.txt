Hey guys! This project is still in development but the overall mechanics for this game
will be similar to Oregon Trail but differs as it takes mechanics from Fallout and DnD.

It will have a skill based system that determines in-game actions and decisions 
that will impact the ending the player will get. Random chance events can occur 
during the story as well and can impact endings if correct or incorrect choices are made. 
Like DnD, die roll chances are affected by player stats.

Context for the story is still being decided but will follow a post apocalyptic
scene across a vast part of land (still deciding on where it will be.)

For now, it will be called: "Travel Game"
