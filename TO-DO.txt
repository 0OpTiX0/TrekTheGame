Questions:
    How will stat generation work? 
        Dnd has several ways, including random generation, point buy and standard array.
        Most video games have the player set it themselves (Like Fallout)
        Another potential way is character classes, with each class having good stats and bad stats
    
    What is the range of stats?
        I.e: what is the minimum in a stat vs the max, Dnd is 1 - 20, some games I've seen do 0 - 10, some do -5 - 5 (negatives meaning they are bad at a skill)
   
    How many characters can the player control? 
        I think the original oregon trail has 4 characters in your "party"
