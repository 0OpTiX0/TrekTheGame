    About: 
        Travel Game will be similar to Oregon Trail but differs as it takes 
        mechanics from Fallout and DnD.A skill based system will determines 
        in-game actions and decisions that will impact the ending the player 
        will get. Random chance events can occur during the story as well and 
        can impact endings if correct or incorrect choices are made. Like DnD, 
        die roll chances are affected by player stats.

    Setting:
        A post-apocalyptic scene across a vast part of the land (TBD)

    Program Details:
        This game will be written in C++ and should be able to run on multiple 
        platforms

//--------------------------------CODE FORMAT---------------------------------//

    This code should follow Google C++ Style Guide as it is a very popular and 
    commonly used style sheet. Every change should be well commented in the 
    commit descriptions and code should be well documented. Max column length 
    should be set to 80 characters long to improve visibility.

    You can find the link to the Style Guide here:
        https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

    NO CHATGPT!!! The whole point is to show what we know, not what we don't!
